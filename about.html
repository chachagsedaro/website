      My name is Vansh Murad Kalia and my interests sit at the cross-section of new-age media technology, design, ethics, economics, and behavior. 
    

      <br><br>

      
      I’m from Punjab in India. I moved to the United States in 2015 to pursue my Bachelor’s degree at the University of Chicago in Economics and graduated in 2018. 
      <br><br>

      I am trained in economics and the financial markets as I’ve been working as an investment research associate at BlackRock in New York since 2019. Through my work, I developed an interest in technology and data science and as such, I’m currently also pursuing a Master’s in QMSS at Columbia University. 
      
      Like most multi-disciplinary artists or scholars, my personal interests span a wide range of topics but my academic research focuses on the cross-section of new-age media technology, design, economics, and behavior. I believe every generation is blessed with a gift and for my generation, that gift has been the internet and technology. 
      
      However, it’s upon us to make sure we don’t exploit it like we did with fossil fuels and pass this gift on to the next generation in a sustainable fashion. As such, I’m interested in researching creative technology and design improvements that can effect a positive behavioral impact on users and help grow a sustainable economy.
